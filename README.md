# FusionMachine

Developed in Lua, using Corona.

What I'm trying to do is replicate the fusion mechanic present in the game "Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories" (PS1), but with the much greater current card pool of the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG.

Maybe this will become a Forbidden Memories remake someday. Maybe not.
